sublime-settings
================

A git repo for keeping my SublimeText settings consistent across dev environments

### User Preferences

Can be found in the file [Preferences.sublime-settings](./Preferences.sublime-settings)

### Editing User Preferences

The sublime text user preferences file is stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text {2,3}/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings` (choose 2 or 3 depending upon your version of ST).

You can edit this file directly, or go through the sublime text preferences panel
